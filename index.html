        <div class="about">I am a rising senior at Ardrey Kell High School in North Carolina. I have a passion for both biology and computer science which is quite intriguing and leads me to many oppurtunities. I believe that it is curiosity and persistance that brings about meaningful change. My values are rooted in a desire to make a positive impact, whether through educating others or pushing the boundaries of what science and technology can achieve. </div>
        <div class="twoabout">My journey in STEM has been shaped by a diverse range of experiences that span both biology and computer science. From conducting research on biophilic design in urban neighborhoods to earning recognition in geospatial technology competitions, I've cultivated a skill set that blends analytical thinking with creative problem-solving. Volunteering at Idea Lab Kids and Discovery Place Science has further enriched my understanding of how to engage others in the wonders of science, fueling my ambition to pursue a career at the intersection of these fields.

        <div class="about">I am a rising sophomore at The Br  onx High School of Science. I am interested in math and a little bit of computer science. I am currently on the Math team and Robotics team for bronx science. I can code in python, java, a javascript. For web development, I am able to code in html and css. I became interested in coding through the robotics team, which my friend introduced to me. Coding was related to math, which is what I was initially interested in.</div>
        <div class="twoabout">In the future, I would like to work in the math field as a college professor or another sort of math teacher. On the side, I would like to be a mathematician and reserearch math. I believe coding can help me in this journey. I do math competiviely at competitions with my peers on the Math team and participated in contests such as the Stuyvesant DMI and Horrace Mann School mathematics competition.</div>

        <div class="about">My name is Alberto Perez Vidal. I am a Mexican-American student going to school in Harlem, New York.  I am a very hardworking student and I do very well in school and working with others. I one day hope to go into the field of engineering, more specifically into civil or aerospace engineering. I developed my goal of going into the field of engineering during my junior year of high school when I took AP Calculus and Physics and realized how much I would love to plan, design, and supervise the construction and maintenance of infrastructure projects while taking into account the effects of an environment around it.  
        </div>
        <div class="twoabout">I currently attend A. Philip Randolph Campus High school where I will be attending this year heading into my senior year. I have been on the honor roll top 10 for every semester I have completed. I am also in the National Honor Society and currently hold a 4.0 GPA. This school doesn’t offer many AP classes and I have taken most of them. I play for the soccer and lacrosse teams for this school. I am in the engineering academy and take most of the stem courses offered at this school.
