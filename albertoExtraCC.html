        I am the Vice President of a newly made Engineering Program called Path 2 Engineering(P2E). I am very passionate about going into the STEM field and for this reason I wanted to take part in helping other people who have the same the same goal I have in any way I can by being the Vice President. P2E's goal is to be a safe space in which members can discover their love for engineering and a where creativity can be expressed freely with no judgment. Our vision for Pathways 2 Engineering next year is devoted to different types of engineering.

        The Neubauer Phoenix STEM Summer Program included me spending one week on the UChicago campus. After I completed an online mathematics course, I resided on campus for one week and explored the opportunities available to me by being at UChicago. Through a week of taking real college courses, meeting college professors, and experiencing facility tours, I had the opportunity to hear from world-renowned UChicago faculty in molecular engineering, mathematics, computer science, and other fields.

      I started playing Lacrosse for the very first time in my freshman year of high school but i did not quickly become the player I am today. I started off nervous and I was doubting myself every game. It wasn't until my sophomore year when I finally learned to embrace my fears and I became a better player and better person. Through my hard work and dedication I became voted the Lacrosse Captain along with two other captains and I helped lead my team to the playoffs. I'm now going into my senior year and I can't wait until my season starts up again.

        I have been playing soccer since I was 8 and when I got to high school I joined my school's soccer team. It took me a while to become captain but I was always a team player. I am a right back and I love running and having to defend people especially when there's pressure on it. I became a captain my junior year and my team went to the second round of playoffs where we unfortunately lost. I still plan on playing soccer after high school and for my senior year. I am very excited for what the future has in store for this sport.

      <p class="description">I joined this program with zero coding experience and I had trouble keeping up with the fast paced curriculum. I don't regret taking part in this program at all as I can say I definetely learned something new and because I was able to make it through the whole 3 weeks. </p>
